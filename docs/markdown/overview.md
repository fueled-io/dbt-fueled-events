# Fueled DBT Package Development for Track and Identify Events

## Context

This initial documentation page is for planning and project management of Fueled's data warehouse push of Fueled client-side and server-side events.
Later, this page will be turned into public documentation _(though the information is still useful to DBT end users now...)_.

## To Do

[x] Document what Fueled event attributes should be mapped to our Data Warehouse Destination.

[ ] Develop JSON Schema file for validation.

[ ] Ticket out tasks related to implementing event schema.

## Fueled Event Mapping

### Cart Viewed

Client-side event. The Fueled Event Attributes below are pulled from the JSON payloads sent to Fueled's Datahub.

#### Columns to remove from existing implementation, _if easy enough_:

- context_passed_ip - Not sure how this differs from `context_ip`. We need a passed IP from the associated client-side events, if availabe.
- context_request_ip - Ditto --^
- timestamp
- uuid_ts

### Checkout Started

Generally a server-side event - but our specification should support client-side implementations. The Fueled Event Attributes below are pulled from the JSON payloads sent to Fueled's Datahub.

#### Columns to remove from existing implementation, _if easy enough_:

- context_passed_ip - Not sure how this differs from `context_ip`. We need a passed IP from the associated client-side events, if availabe.
- context_request_ip - Ditto --^
- timestamp
- uuid_ts

#### Columns to remove from existing implementation, _if easy enough_:

- context_passed_ip - Not sure how this differs from `context_ip`. We need a passed IP from the associated client-side events, if availabe.
- context_request_ip - Ditto --^
- timestamp
- uuid_ts

Generally a server-side event - but our specification should support client-side implementations. The Fueled Event Attributes below are pulled from the JSON payloads sent to Fueled's Datahub.

**TODO:** Consider adding shipping addresses to this schema - Or better, add shipping events to Destination.

#### Columns to remove from existing implementation, _if easy enough_:

- context_passed_ip - Not sure how this differs from `context_ip`. We need a passed IP from the associated client-side events, if availabe.
- context_request_ip - Ditto --^
- timestamp
- uuid_ts
